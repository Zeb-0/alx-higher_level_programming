	10. Technical interview preparation:

		You are not allowed to google anything
	
		Whiteboard first

		This task and all future technical interview prep tasks will include checks for the efficiency of your solution, i.e. is your solution’s runtime fast enough, does your solution require extra memory usage / mallocs, etc.

	Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

		. Prototype: int check_cycle(listint_t *list);

		. Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle

	Requirements:

		.Only these functions are allowed: write, printf, putchar, puts, malloc, free

		. Use the function write from the sys module
	
		. you are not allowed to use print

		. Your script should print to stderr

		. Your script should exit with the status code 1


	12. Write a script that compiles a Python script file.

	The Python file name will be stored in the environment variable $PYFILE

	The output filename has to be $PYFILEc (ex: export PYFILE=my_main.py => output filename: my_main.pyc)


	13. Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:


			 3           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (98)
			             3 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)

			             10 BINARY_ADD
			             11 RETURN_VALUE

			Tip: Python bytecode
